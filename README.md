CryptoFy is designed using React and Chakra Ui which let us check out different cryptocurrencies and also give information about the top exchanges. I used useEffect and useState hooks a lot in this to change the states, and I used Chartjs to show the chart on the website. A completely responsive website.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
